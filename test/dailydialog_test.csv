But we don't know who can stay with her . <utterance> B: You need a babysitter . <utterance> A: Yes , I'd ask Jill , the girl I've had before , but I need someone overnight.Maybe even for two nights . <utterance> B: I could have Suzy stay at my place . <utterance> A: I don't want to do that to you , Karen . <utterance> B: Why not ? <utterance> A: Your own kids would get Suzy's cold . I think it would be better to have a good babysitter here . But I don't know who to ask . I need someone more mature than Jill . It might even be for two or three days . <utterance> B: I know who we can ask . There is a girl I know , Sara Ralston.She is 17 , and she will usually take this kind of job . I know her from my church , and I trust her completely . <utterance> A: I'd like to talk with her.This is short notice , I know . But Hank and I are leaving tonight . <utterance> B: I'll get you her number . I hope she can do it . She is very responsible . <utterance> A: I'm glad you know someone . I knew you would be the best person to ask about this . I don't want to insult Jill or her mother . I think Jill maybe could do it.But I'd rather have someone a little older . <utterance> B: I'll go home and get Sara's number . I'll call her first myself . <utterance> A: Great . Then call me and let me know if she's free ."

First of all , it ’ s very important for you not to be late . Job interviewers usually don ’ t think very highly of a candidate who arrives ten minutes after the appointed time , only to explain that he could not find the place or that there was heavy traffic . <utterance> A: Yeah , that's very important . <utterance> B: So you ’ d better explore the place the day before and at the same time , look around to see what the employees are wearing . So the next day you will arrive early for the appointment . <utterance> A: I ’ ll try my best to make a good impression on the interviewer . <utterance> B: That ’ s right . You need to create a good image in a limited time , usually about 30 to 45 minutes . <utterance> A: It ’ s always easier to say something than to do it . <utterance> B: It ’ s not too difficult to make a good impression . For example , you should take care to appear well-groomed and modestly dressed . Avoid the extremes of a too elaborate or too casual style . This will put you on the same level as other applicants and make the interviewer consider more important qualifications . <utterance> A: But I love wearing T-shirts and jeans . <utterance> B: I advise you not to wear a too casual style when going to an interview . Informal clothes as well as torn jeans and dirty shoes convey the impression that you are not serious about the job , or that you may be casual about your work as you are about your clothes . <utterance> A: It ’ s a pity that I cannot afford more expensive clothes . <utterance> B: You misunderstood me . Clothes which are too colorful or too expensive suggest that you do not understand what behavior is appropriate for the job , or that you are snobbish or frivolous . <utterance> A: I know what you mean . I ought to wear right clothes at the right time . <utterance> B: You got it . Only in this way can you gain the respect of the interviewer and his confidence in your judgement . <utterance> A: It seems that ' clothes make the man ' . <utterance> B: It may not be true , but the first and lasting impression of you is determined by your clothes and behavior ."
