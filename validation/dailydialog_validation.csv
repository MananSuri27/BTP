It's ready and waiting in my account . <utterance> A: The next step is for us to recommend a dealer to you , who are already contracted to us , so ... <utterance> B: Could I just stop you there ?

50,284,"#ROOT# <utterance> A: What do you think of our price ? <utterance> B: Your price has gone up sharply , hasn't it ? <utterance> A: Yes . We regret we cannot maintain our original price . Since the prices of the raw materials have been raised , we have to adjust the price of our products accordingly . <utterance> B: I agree with you there , but your price is unreasonable . <utterance> A: I don't think so . You must compare our price with that of other export houses . I'm sure our offer is in line with the prevailing market price level . <utterance> B: I don't think we'll be able to pay the price . To have this business concluded , you need to lower your price at least by 3 % . <utterance> A: I ’ m afraid that there is no room for any reduction in price . <utterance> B: Don't you agree with me that in the long run , moderate prices will bring about large sales and more profit ? <utterance> A: We've already cut down our price to cost level . <utterance> B: Is that all ? <utterance> A: Yes , this is the best we can do . <utterance> B: I'm sorry we can't handle the price you offered ."

And also , money in the bank earns interest . <utterance> B: But what if I need my money suddenly ? <utterance> A: The bank will give you a PIN , and you can withdraw money from any ATM . <utterance> B: Great ! So it ’ s almost the same as keeping it under the matters ! <utterance> A: Not quite . You have to maintain a minimum balance of twenty dollars . And sometimes the bank has service charges .

I think I had it when I left the house.But what should I do ? <utterance> B: Well , the first thing you should do is make sure it's not at home.Then , if it isn't , you need to call your credit card companies and cancel your cards .

83,804,"#ROOT# <utterance> A: I think you know already that I want to discuss the represent - ton for your alarm clocks . <utterance> B: Yes , Mr . Bergeron . You mentioned that in your letter . To tell you the truth , your proposal surprised us . <utterance> A: Is that so ? Anyhow I want to go over the details with you in person , so you can give my suggestion thorough consideration . Our firm specializes in this line of business . We have six sales representatives , who are on the road all the time , covering the whole of the European market . <utterance> B: Do you sell direct to shops ? <utterance> A: Yes , we specialize in handling clocks and watches of all sorts . We have well established channels of distribution and we canvass the retailers direct , without any middlemen . <utterance> B: Do you keep a stock of these things ? <utterance> A: In some cases , such as the wristwatches , which always have a steady market , we keep a stock in London and act as distributors as well as agents . Generally , however , we pass on the orders of our clients to the manufacturers for supply . We are paid for our service , of course . <utterance> B: That is , your commission . <utterance> A: Yes , our commission is very reasonable . We usually get a 10 % commission of the amount on every deal . <utterance> B: Our agents in other areas usually get a 3-5 % commission . <utterance> A: The European market is not familiar with your products . You have competitors from Japan and other continental countries . At the beginning of our campaign , there is sales resistance to overcome , we must send out salesmen to do a lot of traveling and spend a considerable amount of money on advertising in news - papers and TV programs . A 10 % commission will not leave us much . <utterance> B: According to your estimate , what is the maximum annual turn - over you can fulfill , in round figures , of course ? <utterance> A: We will always do our utmost to enlarge the business , as our remuneration increases with the turnover , but we will not guar - ante anything , at least not to begin with . <utterance> B: We appreciate very much your intention to push the sale of our products . But our suggestion to you , Mr . Bergeron , as a preliminary step , is to do a little research into the market ... <utterance> A: Do you mean to say you refuse us the agency ? <utterance> B: Mr . Bergeron , you leave us no alternative . We can not give you an exclusive agency of the whole European market without having the slightest idea of your possible annual marketing turnover . Besides our price is worked out according to the costing . A 10 % commission means an increase in our price . We must have the reaction of the buyers in this respect . <utterance> A: Oh , that's just too bad . I intended to make great efforts in selling your products . <utterance> B: Well , we can still carry on our business relationship without the agreement . To start the ball rolling , we will provide you with price lists , catalogues and some samples . Only when you have a thorough knowledge of the marketing possibilities of our products , can we then discuss further details . <utterance> A: Ah , Mrs . Miller , but in this case am I covered ? <utterance> B: Oh , yes . We will give you a 5 % commission on every transaction . <utterance> A: All right , but I'll be back again for the Autumn Fair . And then I hope we can see eye to eye about our commission and the terms of the agency . <utterance> B: Very good . We will discuss the matter again at the next Fair ."

It is not surprising for one to have a crash on the other . <utterance> B: If we think positively , office love can be beneficial to company . <utterance> A: Beneficial ? I don ’ t think so . If two employees get married , they will leave at the same time for a honeymoon , or later one of them will stay at home taking care of babies . If they break up , the company will probably have to relocate one of them to make the workplace more comfortable . By any means , the company must spare extra efforts to solve problems brought by an office dating . <utterance> B: But if two employees are in love , they will be happy . Happy people are more productive . If they develop an intimate relation with each other , they are willing to share knowledge and experience . It can help to improve work efficiency . <utterance> A: I doubt that ."

Wild rice is high in fibre so it's good for your guts and it's high in protein and minerals-I think it's also tastier than normal rice . Yoghurt's good because it's also rich in protein , vitamins and is also acidic .

It's best to find someone who is selling by themselves . <utterance> B: Why ? <utterance> A: Because if the seller has a realtor , their price will be higher.He will have to pay a commission to the realtor . <utterance> B: Hmm . It all sounds very complicated . <utterance> A: It is . But buying a house is very important . So it takes time.That ' s why we haven't done it yet . It's very troublesome . <utterance> B: I want to look in the papers today . Maybe we can see something we like . <utterance> A: Alright . I'll buy a newspaper when I go to the drug store ."
